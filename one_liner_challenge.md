## Trying out using one-liners on FASTA files

Here are some challenge exercises to attempt, but first, you will want to download the file [monday.fasta](monday.fasta) and transfer it to the folder you created on Monday August 14th. 

Make sure both `monday.fasta` and `test.pep` are in your current working directory. It might be helpful to rename `test.pep` to `test.pep.fasta`.

If you are having trouble transfering the file through Cyberduck, you can copy it from `/core/labs/Wegrzyn/akriti/ramp_challenge/files/monday.fasta`


1. Count all sequences in `test.pep.fasta` that have a header line that starts (after the >) with the letter g
2. Count all sequences in all fasta files in your current directory
3. Sum the length of all sequences in `test.pep.fasta`
4. Split the multifasta file `test.pep.fasta` file into separate files
5. Append the word OCTOPUS to all headers of `test.pep.fasta`
6. To remove line breaks in a fasta file (to have one sequence per line) but keep line break in between header and sequence
7. Sample the first 200 bases from all sequences in `test.pep.fasta` 
8. Remove everything after the first space at each line to simplify the fasta headers in `monday.fasta`
9. Copy files to a new folder file_fun2 from a text file with file names, the text file can be found at `/core/labs/Wegrzyn/akriti/ramp_challenge/to_copy/files_to_copy.txt`
